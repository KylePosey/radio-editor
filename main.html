        <h5>It is highly recomended you use this tool on desktop.</h5>
        <h5>Please read the help box for information on using the tool and if you need help on replacing the file be sure to read the help box on the radiopanel.txt window.</h5></p>
		
		
		<p><h5>This tool allows you to put custom chat binds into the radio menu, either by replacing commands you dont use or by taking advantage of
                the 3/4 remaining slots of a radio menu. This tool allows you to edit radio1, radio2, and radio3. I purposely left out the ability to edit
              radio (radio0) since that radio contains all bot commands and a yes/no voice command.</h5></p>
